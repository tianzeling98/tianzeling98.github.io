## About me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am focusing on the fields of deep learning and bioinformatics, especially on decoding mass spectrometry-based proteomic data.  

## Research Interests 
Mass spectrometry data serve as both the starting point and the fundamental unit for proteomic data analysis. My research focuses on developing deep learning-based analytical    algorithms to explore mass spectrometry-based proteomic data from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. These efforts include:<br>  
(1) Unsupervised representation learning methods to decode complex patterns in tandemmass spectra.<br>  
(2) Algorithms for de novo sequencing identification in tandem mass spectra.<br>  
(3) Algorithms designed to correct absolute protein quantification by predicting peptidebiases during enzymatic digestion, liquid chromatography and in a mass spectrometer.
