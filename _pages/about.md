# &#128515; About me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Tsinghua University](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Cheng Chang](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0361-2438)/[Fuchu He](https://pi-hub.org.cn/news/show_who_scientific_info/91). I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://lifesciences.sysu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am focusing on the fields of deep learning and bioinformatics, especially on decoding mass spectrometry-based proteomic data.<br> 
&#128293;If you are interested in what we are doing, don’t hesitate to send me an email—any discussion or cooperation is very welcome.

## Overview

## Details
Mass spectrometry data serve as both the starting point and the fundamental unit for proteomic data analysis. My research focuses on developing deep learning-based algorithms to explore mass spectrometry-based proteomic data. Meanwhile, we are also exploring the application of these algorithms for the study of dark proteome. These efforts include:<br>
&#128309; Unsupervised learning methods to decode complex patterns in tandem mass spectra.<br>
&#128309; Algorithms for de novo sequencing identification in tandem mass spectra.<br>
&#128309; Algorithms designed to correct absolute protein quantification by predicting peptide biases during enzymatic digestion, liquid chromatography and in a mass spectrometer.<br>
&#128309; Comprehensive bioinformatics mining of unannotated components of proteomic data, systematically exploring mutation, alternative splicing, PTMs and non-canonical small proteins.<br>
