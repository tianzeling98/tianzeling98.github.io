## About me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Cheng Chang](https://i-share.ncpsb.org.cn/genee/post/167) / [Fuchu He](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%B4%BA%E7%A6%8F%E5%88%9D/4313734). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am focusing on the fields of deep learning and bioinformatics, especially on decoding mass spectrometry-based proteomic data.  

## Research Interests 
Mass spectrometry data serve as both the starting point and the fundamental unit for proteomic data analysis. My research focuses on developing deep learning-based algorithms to explore mass spectrometry-based proteomic data. Meanwhile, we are also exploring the application of the above-mentioned methods to the study of dark proteome. These efforts include:<br>  
(1) Unsupervised representation learning methods to decode complex patterns in tandem mass spectra.<br>  
(2) Algorithms for de novo sequencing identification in tandem mass spectra.<br>  
(3) Algorithms designed to correct absolute protein quantification by predicting peptide biases during enzymatic digestion, liquid chromatography and in a mass spectrometer.<br>  
(4) Comprehensive bioinformatics mining of unannotated components of proteomic data, systematically exploring mutation, alternative splicing, PTMs and non-canonical small proteins.<br>
